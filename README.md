TYPO3 Extension "Backend User Tools"
====================================

This extension (currently) adds a user listing that is accessible for non-admins. This can be useful for "admins without admin rights", e.g. people managing the users of a site.

Current features:
* **List users by group:** Listing of all backend users, grouped by their (explicitely set) user groups. This module function offers an Excel XML export of a flattened list with the columns "username", "real name", "user group".
* **List all users:** Listing of all backend users including all their (explicitely set) user groups.

Feel free the send pull requests for useful features.
